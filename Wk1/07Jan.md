# Arguments
An argument is made up of premises and a conclusion. Arguments are of two types – deductive and non-deductive.  
A valid deductive argument is one whose premises guarantee its conclusion.  
A sound deductive argument is one which is valid and which has true premises.  

For non-deductive arguments, the analogy of validity is cogency.
