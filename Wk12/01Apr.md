# What Is Psychology?
Psychology is defined as the scientific study of mind, brain and behaviour.  

The mind is what enables us to think, feel, perceive and act. It includes conscious and unconscious process and activities. The brain is simply an organ composed of neurons, which enables the mind to function in a certain way. Behaviour consists of our actions and mannerisms.  

The mind is internal and abstract, while the brain is internal and physiological. Behaviour is external and physiological.  

In terms of perception, the mind is only measurable (?). The brain and behaviour are both observable and measurable.

## Disordered Mind and Behaviour
There are many examples of disorders that affect the mind and the behaviour of individuals, like depression, ADHD, schizophrenia, etc.  

Hallucinations and delusions are common symptoms of schizophrenia. Understood in terms of the SOR (stimulus-organism-response) model, hallucinations are perceptions occurring in the mind *without external stimuli*. Delusions occur when the individual is convinced of some impending danger or conspiracy against them, which belief they refuse to revise in the face of any logical arguments or evidence.  

## Ordered Mind and Behaviour
There are many examples of human activities and mental processes that occur on a daily basis in an ordered mind – perception, memory, searching, navigation, and so on.
