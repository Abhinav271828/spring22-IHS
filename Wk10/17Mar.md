# Colonialism and Literature?
The British colonial period gave rise to a class of people educated in the Western tradition, who spread Western ideas of "goodness" and other values.  

The class distinction between the aristocracy (the class of leisure) and the middle class (the class of people who do skilled work) is related to this.  

There is a spectrum of vernacular literary traditions, flourishing in their respective regions.

# Controversy
Literature has a high possibility of being controversial, and maybe even considered blasphemous, at times.
