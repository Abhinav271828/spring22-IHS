## Change and Continuity
Change and continuity are a main focus across history, but they work differently in the various sub-disciplines (like cultural, political, social, etc.) . 

When we try to identify change, it is important to establish a baseline, or a context. Change is only meaningful when measured against continuity.  

Furthermore, we must distinguish the degree and the manner of change (change in quantity or quality).

## Causes and Consequences
It is also important to understand the causes, or the motives, behind some historical change.  
We also distinguish between immediate, or proximal, and distant causes. Proximal causes can usually be directly linked to the event, while distant causes are harder to connect.  

We must also be careful to distinguish causes from correlations.
