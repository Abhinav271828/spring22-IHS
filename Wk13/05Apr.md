# What Is Psychology? (contd.)
## Goals of Psychology
The goals of psychological studies include the description, explanation, prediction, control of mental and behavioural conditions.

The probability of us paying attention to any environmental phenomenon is determined by the SEEV model – salience, effort, expectation and value.

## Levels of Psychological Analysis
Psychological studies are carried out on three major levels – biological (the underlying chemical forces driving the processes), individual (or cognitive), and social (which takes into account cultural and societal perspective).

Psychology differs from other fields of study in that it frequently involves multiple determinism and interdependence of factors, and is affected by individual differences and cultural and developmental influences.
