# Fundamentals

## Introduction to Critical Thinking
Critical thinking is about making sure you have good reasons for your beliefs. A "good" reason for a belief makes it certain, or at least probable.  

An argument is a set of statements (premises) comprising a reason for another statement (a conclusion). In a good argument (one which supports its conclusion), the premises make the conclusion likely to be true.  

An argument whose premises logically guarantee the truth of the conclusion is called a deductive argument; one which merely makes its conclusion likely is called ampliative.

## Deductive Arguments
A "valid" deductive argument makes it impossible for the premises to be true while the conclusion is false. A valid argument with true premises is called "sound".  

To test an argument's validity, one can think of a counterexample, and some other stuff.

## Abductive Arguments
Abductive arguments are a kind of ampliative argument involving an inference to the best explanation. They are not conclusive; they are just likely to be true.  
Scientific hypotheses rest on abductive arguments.  

Abductive arguments are generally considered good if they fit well with current knowledge, and are as simple as possible.

## Validity
An argument is valid iff the truth of its premises guarantees the truth of its conclusion, *i.e.*, the premises entail the conclusion.

## Truth and Validity
An argument's conclusion is true when it is valid and its premises are true. Such arguments are called "sound".

## Soundness
An argument is sound if it is valid and if its premises are true. The conclusion of a sound argument cannot be false.
