# What Is Philosophy?
## Philosophy Is Everywhere
Philosophy needn't be esoteric – it often comes up in day-to-day life. For example, the question of whether or not it is acceptable to eat meat is philosophical.  
**It isn't:** Some argue that it is wrong to inflict pain on animals.  
$\to$ **It is:** One can buy from humane farms.  
$\to$ **It is:** Some animals, like oysters, can't experience pain.
$\to$ $\to$ How do you know? The relation between the nervous system and consciousness is another philosophical matter.  

**It is:** Christians cite passages from the Genesis, like the one in which God gives humankind the ownership of all life forms on the Earth.  
$\to$ **It isn't:** Lmao Shashwat

## What Is a Philosophical Question?
Part of the answer is that a lot of philosophy concerns "normative" (establishing, relating to, or deriving from a standard or norm, especially of behaviour) questions, like those about right and wrong or good and bad.  

Another part is that philosophy involves questioning assumptions, like God's existence and the authority of the Bible.

## The Philosophical Method
Philosophers state their views clearly and precisely, and give explicit arguments for their claims.

## Philosophy and Science
Science is important to philosophy, but it doesn't answer everything. Questions of moral legitimacy or free will, for instance, are unaddressed in the scientific literature.  

## Why Bother?
It's inevitable; we have to think about how to live, and normative questions naturally enter into this. We also have to understand the differences between people with various worldviews and differing basic assumptions.

# What Are Arguments, and How Should We Evaluate Them?
## Introduction
Philosophers present arguments for their views, in lieu of emotional justifications or appeals to authorities. An *argument* is an attempt to justify some conclusion by rational means.

## Premises and Conclusions

## Evaluating Arguments
There are two questions involved in evaluating an argument: (i) are the premises true? and (ii) to what extent is the conclusion supported by them?  
For example, a common basis for denying the second question is the correlation-causation fallacy.  

Note that claiming an argument is bad is **not** necessarily denying its conclusion. It is only a statement against the present justification.

## Deductive Validity
An argument is *deductively valid* when its conclusion would be true if its premises are true. This has no bearing on whether or not the premises are in fact true.

## Induction and Abduction
These are two other forms of arguments. *Induction* consists of reasoning from a limited sample to a more general case; for example, we could claim that since the Sun has risen every day for the past several millennia, it will rise tomorrow also (independent of any other knowledge). Specifically, this is called *enumerative induction*.  

*Abduction* involves presenting the best explanation for a set of observations and inferring (cautiously) that it must be the correct one. It is also called *inference to the best explanation*.  

Many philosophers say that scientific theories are abductive arguments.
