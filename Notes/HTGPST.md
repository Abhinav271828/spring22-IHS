# 1 The 'a priori'
*A priori* knowledge is knowledge that we do not acquire through our senses. Such knowledge includes the results of mathematical calculations, logical deductions and metaphysical truths (maybe).  

There are two reasons to refute the existence of *a priori* knowledge:

* While it is not acquired through the senses, *a priori* knowledge is not entirely independent of one's experiences. For example, the experience of having learnt maths allows one to carry out calculations.  
* Despite not needing the senses, it can contain information about the real world. This appears paradoxical.  

## Hmm
Ethel carried out the sum on inputs that she received through her senses. Is it still a priori? Maybe we should restrict the thought process.
```Someone told Ethel they put 461 in account -> Someone told Ethel they put 378 in account -> Ethel knows that 461 + 378 is in her account -> Ethel knows that 839 is in her account```
Only step 3 is independent of Ethel's perception. Does it count as "knowledge"?  

Can we carry out any reflection or cognition independent of perception? From birth we're always perceiving things; it can't be avoided. Can we think having abstracted away from what we feel? I don't think so.  

The only thing we can possibly reason about without reference to perceived things is the self, which idek what it is so lets not go there.  

Question 9: Hmm *a priori* knowledge can have conditional form. I didn't think of that. Is that the only form it can take? Seems like it.  
Like Ethel's case would be, "if this person put 461, and that person put 378, then it's 839 now". The actual truth of the premises is empirical, though, isn't it? So the conclusion is empirical and the second objection is surmounted.  
But the first one maybe not. Do we learn how to handle, manipulate implications from experience? If so, then a priori is nonsense. If the brain develops logic by itself (?????) then ig it can work out.  

Question 6: I don't know. What is knowledge? Justified true belief? A priori knowledge is definitely a belief, but what are "justified" and "true"? Leads back to how our brain figured out logic. Is it experience or innate?  
What level of justification are we looking for? How to verify truth?

# 32 Artificial Intelligence
Some people think computes can think; some think that if they exhibit some behaviour, we could conclude that they are genuinely intelligent.  
The Turing test is one such behavioural manifestation people look for.  

$\to$ Some respond that what matters is what the computer is doing inside the hood. What evidence do we have for internal thinking? What evidence do we have for it in the case of humans, other than external behaviour?  
$\to$ Then maybe what matters is completely replicating human neurological behaviour, rather than a subset, as in the Turing test.
