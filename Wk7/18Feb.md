# The Fact
The principles of history have been studied by multiple scholars in the past, like Thucydides, Ibn al-Khaldun, and Edward Gibbon. Of these, Gibbon was the first to give importance to objectivity.  
Leopold von Ranke further solidified the foundations of history by separating facts from their interpretations and giving priority to primary sources.  

However, it was later recognised that facts cannot be made independent of its point of view. There is no such thing as a neutral fact; it is created by our perception and our recognition of it as a fact.
